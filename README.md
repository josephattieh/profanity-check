# Profanity Check

The past decade has seen numerous waves of technological advancements that can be noticed by the significant increase in the use of smart devices and the internet. Unfortunately, some people have been exploiting the anonymity provided by the internet, as more people are being victims of cyberbullying and verbal abuse. To solve this issue, a lot of researchers have worked on Profanity Detection. Since this is a worldwide problem immune to language and cultural differences, it is crucial to be able to scale these systems to support multiple languages. In this project, we propose to explore Multilingual Profanity Detection through two solutions: the first solution relies on multilingual embeddings and a classification layer to perform the classification.  The second solution tries to perform Knowledge Distillation to transfer knowledge from a language to another.
